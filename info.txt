React is a library for building UI

referred to as a front-end 'framework' similar to Angular or Vue

Why React?
-Structure the view layer of the app
-Reusuable components with their own state
-JSX (JavaScript Syntax Entension): Dynamic markup
-Interactive UIs with Vitual DOM
-Performance and testing benefits
-Popular in industry right now (2022)

Working with State:
-Components can have 'state' which is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves
    -i.e. collapsable menu which has open and closed 'states'
-Data is part of a particular state but sometimes needs to be shared between components
    -'App' or 'global' state refers to state that is available to the entire UI, not just a single component

Note: Prior to React 16.8, you couldn't use function components with 'hooks' because they couldn't hold state, therefore classes were used

React Hooks are functions that let us 'hook' into the React state and lifecycle features from function components
-'useState': returns a stateful value and a function to update into; IMMUTABLE, use function to reproduce new state
-'useEffect': perform side effects in function components
-'useContext, useReducer, useRef': beyond scope of crash course by Traversy Media

Note: can create your own custom Hooks
